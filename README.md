## Challanges Faced 🚫

1. **Challenge:** Designing an intuitive and responsive user interface using JavaFX was challenging due to the complexity of handling various components and ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Solution:** Invested time in learning JavaFX layout management and best practices, and utilized Scene Builder for visual design, which made it easier to arrange UI elements and test different layouts.

2. **Challenge:** Integrating MySQL with the Java application and managing complex queries for different operations was initially difficult, especially when handling large datasets.

**Solution:** Focused on optimizing SQL queries and properly indexing the database tables. Additionally, used JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) effectively to ensure seamless interaction between the Java application and MySQL database.

3. **Challenge:** Setting up automated email notifications was tricky due to the need to manage different email services and ensure reliable delivery.

**Solution:** Utilized the JavaMail API and configured it with SMTP servers. Carefully handled exceptions and tested the functionality extensively to ensure that emails were sent correctly and on time.
